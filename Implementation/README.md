# Flappy Bird (using Pygame)

A clone of the popular app *Flappy Bird*, using Pygame.

This code was discussed [on Code Review][codereview].

I'm not actively maintaining this code; this repo is an archive of the code I
wrote for the above question, and some fixes. If you're looking for extra
features, have a look at the forks by [lvalencacomputacao][lvalenca] and
[nimitbhardwaj][nimit] instead.

## Playing the game

You control the little bird. You can make it climb by pressing `↑` (up), `⏎`
(return), `␣` (space), or clicking into the window. Don't crash into any pipes!
For every pipe you pass without colliding, you get one point.
