abstract="This study explores the history of board games and game boards, beginning with a discussion of the origin of play and games. Then, it summarises ancient game boards from all over the world. Finally, it discusses the development and modification of these games over time. Some of the games disappeared, while others survived. Subsequently, new board games that are descendants of the ancient games emerged. Exploring the history of games is one way to explore human nature.",
